  ## Scaling design at a fortune 250 financial institution

  Over the course of four years, I've been a core contributor to grassroots design system at a major financial institution. In addition to developing and designing the components themselves, I've been responsible for the design system's interface, change management, and release communications.

ADEL's text utility page, which I designed so developers can have a clear understanding of what text utility classes are available in the system, and how they modify the appearance of a text string.
