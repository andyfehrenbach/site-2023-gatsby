Since this was a pretty short project, and didn't require any design on my part, the best way to show this work is probably a before and after. The new homepage for Shift Worship features stunning looping background video and an image gallery built using CSS grid. Certain sections on the homepage have a vignette effect applied that allows the background video to show through.
