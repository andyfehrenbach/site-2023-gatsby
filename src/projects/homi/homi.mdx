## Aligning a startup's design language with their audience

Moving at lightspeed at a young social networking startup, I overhauled the design of two separate web apps and landing pages—Homi Web and Homi Recruiter. Responsibilites ranged from whiteboarding and sketch mockups, to art directing photoshoots (really!), to interactive frontend development. The madlib on the homepage is still one of the wildest things i've ever developed, and I even got it to display well on mobile devices. The thing I'm most proud of is that I was able to create a visual language that resonated with their millenial audience, and allowed Homi to stand out in sea of social media sameness.

### Details

Home view of the Homi Recrutier web app, featuring a recruiter's active postings, recommended candidates, and saved candidates.

### Impact

During my year at Homi, daily active users increased by 245%. Since growth is the lifeblood of any startup, this design speaks for itself.
