## Aligning a startup's design language with their audience

Moving quickly at a young social networking startup, I overhauled the design of two separate web apps and landing pages—Homi Web and Homi Recruiter. Responsibilities ranged from whiteboarding and sketch mockups, to art directing photo shoots (really!), to interactive frontend development. The Mad Lib on the homepage is still one of the wildest things i've ever developed, and I even got it to display well on mobile devices. The thing I'm most proud of is that I was able to create a visual language that resonated with their millennial audience, and allowed Homi to stand out in sea of social media sameness.

### Details
