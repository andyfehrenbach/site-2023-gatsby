# Adel Design System

Over the course of four years, I've been a core contributor to grassroots design system at a major financial institution. In addition to developing and designing the components themselves, I've been responsible for the design system's interface, change management, and release communications.

## Details
ADEL's Card component. Shown is a component example, description, and code block.

ADEL's Design Token table, showing a portion of the data visualization color palette.

A full ADEL component page. Note how much focus we place on education and communication in our component documentation pages.

ADEL's example form, complete with an event log that shows what validations run on a given form event.

multi-state animation on an ADEL icon button.

ADEL's text utility page, which I designed so developers can have a clear understanding of what text utility classes are available in the system, and how they modify the appearance of a text string.

## Impact
ADEL is currently used by 22 product teams at this financial instution, and has four CSS themes available. In the 2020 ADEL developer satisfaction survey, 90% of respondents were very satisfied or better with the design system.
